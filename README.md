# OPC UA Skill Model

This repository contains the Model.xml files for the OPC UA Skill Model developed inside the SOArc VDMA Companion Specification Group.

Further details on the Model.xml format can be found here:
https://opcua.rocks/custom-information-models/

The model is based on the publication:

S. Profanter, A. Breitkreuz, M. Rickert, and A. Knoll, "A Hardware-Agnostic OPC UA Skill Model for Robot Manipulators and Tools,"
in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies And Factory Automation (ETFA), Zaragoza, Spain, Sep. 2019

The full-text PDF is available here: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1507596

## Will this model be supported by the OPC Foundation?

This model is part of the official VDMA and OPC Foundation joint working group for a skill concept which can be used inside OPC UA.

[Service-Oriented Architectures and real-time Control (SOArc)](https://www.th-owl.de/init/aktuelles/news/news-detail/news/kick-off-meeting-vdma-arbeitsgruppe-service-orientierte-architekturen-und-real-time-control-soarc.html)

This repository is a first draft of a possible skill model, which acts as a basis for further improvement inside the working group.

## How to use

The `master` branch only contains the `*Model.xml` files, not the compiled NodeSet2.xml files.

On every push to a branch, an is executed and the resultin model files are pushed back to the branch 'master-published'.

Have a look at the resulting files here:
https://github.com/opcua-skills/skill-nodeset/tree/master-published/Published

And for examples:
https://github.com/opcua-skills/skill-nodeset/tree/master-examples/Examples

If you like to manually build the files on your machine, follow these steps:

This build process is using a pre-built docker container based on the official UA-ModelCompiler source code.
There's currently an open pull-request (https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler/pull/36) to add the necessary docker files to the official repository. In the meantime you can use my docker container:
[sailavid/ua-modelcompiler](https://cloud.docker.com/u/sailavid/repository/docker/sailavid/ua-modelcompiler).

1. Install docker on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd skill-nodeset`
4. Then run the provided `build.sh` or the docker container for `skillModel`:
	```bash
	docker run \
		  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/model/src \
		  --entrypoint "/app/PublishModel.sh" \
		  sailavid/ua-modelcompiler \
		   /model/src/SkillsModel Opc.Ua.Skills /model/src/Published
	```
5. To build an example, run the following:
	```bash
	docker run \
		  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/model/src \
		  --entrypoint "/app/PublishModel.sh" \
		  sailavid/ua-modelcompiler \
		   /model/src/exampleModel/LinearAxisWithGripperModel Example.LinearAxisWithGripper /model/src/Examples
	```

This will create all the compiled NodeSet2.xml files inside the `Published` folder.
With this command you can also compiler your own model files, just adapt the last line accordingly.
